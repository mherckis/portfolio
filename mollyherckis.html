		<h2>Hi! My name is Molly and this is a website all about me. To start off, here are a couple fun facts about me...</h2>

		<p>I have a dog named Mac - he's a cockapoo and he's about 6 years old and he is the cutest. My favorite candy is Sour Patch Watermelon, and my favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor is No Thai.</p>
		<p>I really like rap music: my favorite artists are Mac Miller and Kanye West. I'm also huge Beyonce fan, and I really like Queen's album called "A Night At the Opera."</p>
		<p>This summer, I am super excited to be joining Citi Bank in their New York City office as a Risk Management Analyst! I'm not sure exactly what I want to do yet, but I hope my internship will combine my interests in both technology and working with people and numbers.</p>
