		<p>Hi! My name is Molly and this is a website all about me. To start off, here are a couple fun facts about me...</p>

		<p>I have a dog named Mac - he's a cockapoo and he's about 6 years old and he is the cutest. My favorite candy is Sour Patch Watermelon, and my favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor is No Thai.</p>
		<p>I really like rap music: my favorite artists are Mac Miller and Kanye West. I'm also huge Beyonce fan as well :)</p>
